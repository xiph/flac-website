       <title>FLAC 1.1.2 released</title>
       <description>New in this release are small decoding speedups for all platforms, small encoding speedups in fast (non-LPC) mode, streaming support in the XMMS plugin, and several bug fixes.  For developers there are also a few additions and changes to the metadata API to make working with tags easier.  See the changelog entry for complete details.  This release actually wasn't supposed to happen so soon, but needed to be made to fix library naming and build problems in FLAC 1.1.1 that caused trouble for package maintainers, so unless you are having trouble with one of the particular bugs that got fixed in 1.1.2 then there is not much of a need to upgrade.</description>

       <title>FLAC joins the Xiph project</title>
       <description>FLAC has joined the Xiph project. Xiph.org is behind other free codecs such as Vorbis, Theora, and Speex. Our merger with Xiph will bring FLAC into the ranks and lead to better integration with the Ogg multimedia framework. Note that the FLAC format is not changing, native FLAC will continue to exist, and the command-line tools and plugins will continue to work as before.  The codec libraries will now be available under Xiph's BSD-like license. Over the next few days we will be transitioning normal operations off SourceForge and over to Xiph.org; first will be CVS and the web pages, followed by the mailing lists, bug tracker, and file release area.  We will keep a mirror here until the transition is complete.  It's OK to send patches to the flac-dev list but they won't be able to be integrated until CVS is fully moved over.</description>

       <title>FLAC 1.1.0 released</title>
       <description>I didn't get everything in that I wanted, but it's high time for a release. Note that the minor version has incremented, meaning forward compatibility was broken (forward compatibility means an earlier decoder can play all streams made by a later decoder). This is only because of a bug in 1.0.4 and prior where the decoder could not properly skip unknown metadata.  The stream format itself has not changed and FLAC is still fully backward-compatible.  All it means is that a FLAC file containing cue sheet metadata will not decode in older decoders.  This bug is fixed in 1.1.0</description>

       <title>FLAC 0.4 released</title>
       <description>This version fixes a bug in the constant subframe detection.  More importantly, a verify option (-V) has been added to flac that verifies the encoding process.  With this option turned on, flac will create a parallel decoder while encoding to make sure that the encoded output decodes to exactly match the original input.  In this way, any unknown bug in the encoder will be caught and flac will abort with an error message</description>
